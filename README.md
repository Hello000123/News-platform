# PressReady — AI News Draft Review and Rewrite

PressReady is a focused local website for one workflow:

    Text or public URL → Review Agent → Calibrated score and feedback → Explicit rewrite → Validated news report

The Review Agent scores the submitted copy once and returns a structured assessment. Rewriting never starts automatically and is never skipped because a review score is high: after either a high or low score, the user can explicitly request a Rewrite Agent call or return to the source input. The rewrite uses the immutable source snapshot that produced the displayed review. A model button lets the user choose DeepSeek V4 Pro or Grok 4.5 for the article; both run with high reasoning. After the first rewrite, `Rewrite with AI Again` opens optional concise/more-detailed controls and an improvement-instructions field before another request is made.

The project is intentionally focused on this workflow. The workspace is protected by approved client or employee accounts backed by Cloudflare D1; it does not provide account-level article history, news search, publishing, distribution, or scheduled work. The active article and its successful rewrite turns are retained in tab-scoped `sessionStorage` so a same-tab reload can continue the current editing session; starting a new draft or changing the source clears that history. User-facing rewrites default to Hong Kong Traditional Chinese, including when the primary input is English or Simplified Chinese, while names, direct quotations, figures, product names, and source-script terms remain verbatim fidelity exceptions.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Node.js 22.13 or newer
- npm
- A DeepSeek API key with access to DeepSeek V4 Pro
- An xAI API key with access to Grok 4.5

From PowerShell:

    cd "C:\AI\AI-Agent-News-Review-Rewrite"
    npm install
    Copy-Item .env.example .env.local

Open .env.local and add both provider keys. Never commit that file.

## Environment variables

Required:

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XAI_API_KEY | your-key | Server-only xAI credential |
| DEEPSEEK_API_KEY | your-key | Server-only DeepSeek credential |
| AI_MODEL | grok-4.5 | Initial website model; must be `grok-4.5` or `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| REVIEW_PASS_SCORE | 80 | Overall score used to label a review as passing |

Optional server settings:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XAI_API_BASE_URL | https://api.x.ai/v1 | xAI base URL; useful for isolated mock testing |
| XAI_TIMEOUT_MS | 600000 | Per-completion abort timeout in milliseconds, from 1,000 to 600,000 |
| XAI_STREAM | true | Stream the provider response so long reasoning remains active; `false` keeps the supported non-streaming parser |
| DEEPSEEK_API_BASE_URL | https://api.deepseek.com | DeepSeek OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| DEEPSEEK_TIMEOUT_MS | 600000 | Per-completion DeepSeek timeout in milliseconds |
| DEEPSEEK_STREAM | true | Stream DeepSeek responses; `false` uses the non-streaming parser |

Invalid pass scores fall back to 80. Invalid timeouts fall back to 600 seconds. Invalid stream values fall back to `true`. Restart the development server after changing environment variables.

## AI provider configuration

As of July 27, 2026, this project uses stateless OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoints:

    POST https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions
    POST https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions

The website offers an allowlisted per-article choice between `deepseek-v4-pro` and `grok-4.5`. `AI_MODEL` sets the initial choice when it matches one of those IDs; otherwise the picker starts on `grok-4.5`. The selected model is validated by the backend and routed only to its matching provider for both review and rewrite requests. Arbitrary browser-supplied model identifiers, including `grok-4.3`, are rejected before any provider request.

Both selectable models explicitly use the highest supported reasoning level:

    reasoning_effort: "high"

Chat Completions returns only the model's final answer; the application does not expose a reasoning trace. Upstream streaming is enabled by default and parses content deltas, finish reasons, keep-alive comments, usage-only events, and `[DONE]`; the non-streaming response shape remains supported. The review call requests a JSON object and validates every field with a strict Zod schema. The rewrite call requests normal text. Both allow up to 64,000 output tokens so high-effort reasoning and long source material have room to complete.

## Development

    npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To test from another device on the same local network, open
`http://<this-computer's-LAN-IP>:3000`. The development configuration
automatically allows the computer's active non-loopback network addresses and
hostname so the Next.js client bundle and hot-reload connection can hydrate on
LAN clients. Restart the server after changing networks or receiving a new IP
address, and allow Node.js through the Windows firewall when prompted.

The Rewrite–Review source section accepts multiple PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX,
PNG, JPEG, or WebP files with a combined maximum of 10 MB. Users review the
file list and combined size before explicitly extracting it. The browser and
backend enforce the same aggregate limit, while the backend also verifies each
declared MIME type against the extension and actual content. Only sanitized,
extracted text is added to the draft; provider keys are never included in
browser source, browser requests, API error bodies, or application logs.

The Rewrite–Review interface supports English and Traditional Chinese for
Hong Kong (`zh-HK`). English is the default. The language button at the upper
right stores the selected interface locale in browser `localStorage` under
`pressready_rewrite_locale`, so it persists across refreshes and later visits.
Translations are maintained in `lib/client/rewrite-i18n.tsx`; switching the
interface never translates or changes draft text, extracted source material,
review evidence, or generated articles.

## Copied news scraper and publishing workflow

The 26-source news scraper is included in `execution/`, with its source definitions in
`execution/sources.json`. Install its Python requirements once, then run a local batch
without uploading to R2:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    npm run scrape:news

Each run writes `.tmp/YYYY-MM-DD/combined.json`. Sign in to the website, open
`/pipeline`, and choose **Import scraper JSON** to upload that file. The application
stores each article's saved text and optional image in the same pipeline used by the
site: **import → rewrite with AI → edit the public headline, story, category, and
featured image → publish**. Editors can upload their own PNG, JPEG, or WebP photo (up
to 10 MB), replace or remove it, or use the advanced public-URL fallback. They can
publish to the homepage only or also archive the story under **科技** (`/technology`)
or **社企專欄** (`/social-enterprise`). A live post remains editable in the same
composer, and can be updated or removed from the public site without creating a
duplicate. Imported source
feeds are paused deliberately, so the site's ordinary RSS scheduler does not try to
fetch their placeholder URLs.

Employees can open any live article and choose **Edit presentation**, or open the
page-wide editor from the homepage, `/technology`, or `/social-enterprise`. The
public-page editor covers each story headline, deck, key point, related-story
headline, latest-note headline, and existing story image while keeping mastheads,
categories, navigation, and layout fixed. Category descriptions and their honest
empty-state copy remain editable even before the first report is published. Draft
and published versions are stored
separately. The Word-style Home ribbon supports direct plain-text editing, undo and
redo, allowlisted fonts and sizes, case changes, bold, italic, underline,
strikethrough, subscript, superscript, highlight colour, and font colour. Colour
values may be entered as `#RRGGBB` or `rgb(R, G, B)`. Images can be resized with a
typed percentage or drag handle inside their existing container; free dragging may
change the aspect ratio and holding Ctrl preserves the source image ratio.
Article blocks remain fixed: they cannot be added, removed, moved, or reordered,
and navigation, columns, margins, header, and footer never enter the saved model.
The server accepts plain text only, validates all style values and image bounds,
and rejects empty or structurally changed blocks. **Discard Change** asks for
confirmation and restores the last saved draft, **Save Changes** keeps a private
draft, and **Publish** promotes the validated version through the existing
publication workflow. Migration `0019_public_page_presentations.sql` adds the
separate draft and published records for the three editable public pages.

Employees can open a client name from the **Client Accounts** tab to view a
dedicated client profile, a server-paginated list of verified published news,
and a structured company summary. **Generate Summary**, **Regenerate Summary**,
and **Generate All Client Summaries** call the currently configured server-side
AI provider; browser code never receives a provider credential. Only the
profile's company, department, and job-title fields plus titles and bounded
excerpts from that client's public news are sent for this purpose. Personal
names, email addresses, phone numbers, supporting documents, drafts, and
unpublished content are excluded from the AI payload. Returned JSON is checked
against a strict schema before a single per-client summary row is inserted or
updated. Clients without enough evidence receive an explicit insufficient-
information result instead of invented fields.

Migration `0018_client_company_summaries.sql` begins recording the authenticated
publisher whenever an article first moves into the live `approved` state. The
client-detail news list uses that server-verified relationship and never trusts
the browser's client ID as ownership evidence. Existing live articles are not
assigned retroactively because the older schema did not retain a reliable
publisher identity; their public availability is unchanged, but they will not
appear under a client until a later authenticated publication transition records
ownership. Summary generation uses the existing `AI_MODEL` and matching
server-only provider configuration, so it introduces no new environment
variables.

The Admin Panel also exposes **Client Overview** as its own top-level tab. Its
initial widget groups every account whose role is `client` by the separately
stored `company_type` field from the latest saved company summary. Aggregation
and percentage calculation happen in D1-backed server code; the browser receives
only company-type labels, counts, percentages, and totals. Matching labels are
grouped case-insensitively. Missing values and recognized placeholders such as
`Unknown`, `Unclassified`, or `N/A` are combined under **Unknown /
Unclassified**. Active, setup-pending, and disabled client accounts all remain
in the denominator so the chart and accessible table describe the entire
retained client base. The overview layout is widget-based so later aggregate
views can be added without changing the top-level navigation.

Apply the latest D1 migration before using the publishing workflow:

    npm run db:migrate:local

The production environment requires the matching `npm run db:migrate:remote` during
the normal deployment procedure. Uploaded post photos use the existing private
`ACCOUNT_DOCUMENTS` R2 binding under an isolated `news-images/` namespace and are
served through opaque, cacheable public image URLs.

The copied scraper can also run on its existing 30-minute Docker schedule with
`docker compose up -d --build`. Its local output is still imported through the Pipeline
screen; configure the optional R2 variables in `.env` only if you also want a remote
copy of the JSON batches.

## Production build

    npm run build
    npm run start

The production server also starts at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) unless PORT is set.

## Score-first review and decision logic

REVIEW_PASS_SCORE defaults to 80.

- `/api/review` builds one immutable source snapshot and invokes only the Review Agent. It never starts a rewrite.
- If text and a URL are both supplied, only the submitted text is sent to the Review Agent; retrieved material remains available to the later Rewrite Agent but cannot influence review scores. For a URL-only request, the extracted article becomes the primary copy and is reviewed as writing.
- Every valid result shows the final score, uncapped weighted score, any deterministic cap and reasons, readiness band, six category rationales, structured findings, strengths, missing information, and recommendations.
- Both a passing/high score and a failing/low score expose `Rewrite with AI`. Clicking it makes a separate `/api/rewrite` request unless another request is already running or the reviewed source has since changed. A score never causes an automatic rewrite and never suppresses an explicit rewrite.
- Editing the text or URL clears any displayed rewrite immediately and marks the existing review as stale; a new review is required before rewriting that changed source.
- Starting a review or rewrite clears the prior output state. Request sequence IDs discard late responses, and rewrite failures never restore an older successful output.

The Review Agent returns category scores and findings, but the backend computes the authoritative weighted and final scores, readiness band, and decision. The weighting is:

- content completeness and internal consistency (`factualCompletenessScore`, retained as a legacy API key): 25%;
- structure and logical flow: 20%;
- clarity and readability: 15%;
- grammar and language quality: 15%;
- news-writing professionalism: 15%;
- attribution and quotation clarity: 10%.

Before weighting, the backend lowers any category score that contradicts the severity of a writing finding or an active writing-readiness flag; it never raises a model score. The three legacy fact-related risk fields remain in the JSON schema but are normalized to `false` and cannot affect scores. The consistency-normalized weighted score is rounded to the nearest whole number. Deterministic writing safeguards then apply the lowest relevant cap:

- 39 for a critical writing finding;
- 59 for a major writing finding, major structural problem, very poor language, serious attribution/quotation clarity problem, or any category below 40;
- 74 for a moderate writing finding or a category below 60;
- 89 for a minor material writing finding or a category below 75.

The final score is the lower of the weighted score and applicable cap. Readiness bands are 90–100 publication-ready, 75–89 strong with limited editing, 60–74 requiring substantial rewriting, 40–59 weak, and 0–39 severely deficient. The backend compares the final score—not the model's claimed arithmetic or decision—with REVIEW_PASS_SCORE.

## Agent behavior

The Review Agent:

- evaluates without rewriting;
- scores only the exact submitted copy's clarity, readability, grammar, language, structure, organisation, coherence, logical flow, tone, style, concision, relevance, internal writing completeness, and suitability for the identified article type;
- does not receive separately retrieved reference text when a user draft is present and never checks claims against external information;
- accepts false, fictional, outdated, satirical, extraordinary, or unverifiable claims as the draft's internal reality and never deducts or caps a score for those qualities;
- never treats missing citations, evidence, links, named sources, or external support as review failures;
- may identify direct contradictions within the draft, unclear statements, missing explanations, or inconsistent details as internal writing problems without declaring which statement is factually correct;
- applies equivalent writing standards across languages and ignores publisher reputation and newsworthiness;
- accepts meaningful relative time expressions such as `yesterday`, `recently`, `昨天`, and `近期`; it flags chronology only when the submitted draft is internally unclear or contradictory;
- deducts for chronology only when the submitted wording is internally unclear or contradictory enough to disrupt comprehension;
- treats media contacts, boilerplates, executive quotations, formal datelines, and calls to action as optional unless essential to the specific announcement;
- returns a required rationale for every category score, explicit readiness-risk flags, structured category/severity findings, strengths, missing information, and recommendations;
- uses temperature 0 for the most repeatable scoring the configured provider can offer;
- returns strict JSON only.

The Rewrite Agent:

- receives the immutable primary source, relevant retrieved page context, validated review feedback, an automatically derived source-language requirement, the current rewrite, retained earlier turns, all prior user instructions, and the latest optional refinement;
- treats source material as factual input and review feedback only as editing guidance;
- keeps compatible earlier improvement instructions active, gives a later conflicting instruction precedence, and applies only the latest selected length preference;
- makes `concise` output shorter and more direct without losing important facts; makes `more_detailed` output fuller only from explicit source or user-supplied information and never fabricates detail merely to add length;
- creates a concise factual headline, strong lead, inverted-pyramid structure, short paragraphs, and neutral newsroom language;
- preserves material supported facts, exact direct quotations, names, dates, numbers, attribution, uncertainty, language, and script;
- never invents facts, translations, context, causal links, quotations, or placeholders;
- removes promotional repetition and press-release artifacts without dropping material facts;
- rejects an empty or malformed candidate, a wrong-language result, changed or untraceable source numbers, omitted or romanized mandatory source-script names, omitted mandatory mixed-language terms, invented direct speech, or an exact/whitespace-only/punctuation-only source copy;
- checks high-confidence named-speaker attribution beside exact preserved quotations in English and Chinese, and routes a reassignment or lost attribution through the same single bounded source-fidelity correction;
- treats equivalent Chinese powers-of-ten and Arabic-number renderings as the same figure (for example, `5.8萬` and `58,000`) while retaining invented-number checks and the original language/script lock;
- returns only a headline, one blank line, and the news-report body after validation.

User drafts, retrieved source material, and feedback are wrapped as JSON data in the prompts and explicitly treated as untrusted content. Generated output is rendered as plain textarea text; HTML is never injected.

### Rewrite-session memory

Each validated rewrite is appended chronologically as `{ rewrittenText, lengthOption, instruction }`. On the next request, the last turn is labelled as the current rewritten version and earlier turns remain ordered, so later instructions build on the same article instead of starting an independent model call. The server remains stateless: the browser sends this context with each rewrite request.

The stable current article state, including its selected model, is stored under one versioned `sessionStorage` key. This survives same-tab refreshes and same-tab navigation, but not the end of the browser-tab session. Editing the source, changing the model, submitting a new review, or choosing `Start New Draft` clears stale rewrite history. A model change marks the displayed review as stale until the article is reviewed again. Malformed stored data and storage failures are ignored safely.

Rewrite requests retain up to 24 successful turns. If a request approaches the 220 KB body limit, older rewritten version bodies are omitted from the request from oldest to newest while their instructions and preferences remain; the original source, active system rules, all retained user instructions, and the newest/current rewrite take priority.

## Quotation preservation and retry behavior

The quotation validator parses `「……」`, `『……』`, `“……”`, `‘……’`, and guarded ASCII quote forms. It uses attribution and sentence-level context to distinguish direct quotations from short labels, supports nested and repeated quotations, and allocates duplicate matches one-to-one. Leading or trailing whitespace and normalized Unicode punctuation forms do not create false failures, but wording and internal punctuation must remain exact.

Validation identifies modified, omitted, split, merged, and punctuation-changed quotations. If the first rewrite is unchanged or fails deterministic format, language, name, number, or quotation validation, the backend makes one focused correction request, for at most two Rewrite Agent calls in that user request; there is no unlimited retry loop. Format, source-name, source-echo, and quotation retries use narrowly scoped correction instructions. If that focused correction returns a factual multi-sentence body without a headline, the backend can restore the already-safe first headline or derive one from the corrected body's first factual clause, then rerun every validator; numeric thousands separators are kept intact. A final punctuation-only quotation mismatch can be repaired deterministically by replacing only the validator-confirmed quote span with the exact source span; wording or structural mismatches are never repaired this way.

If quotation validation still fails, the response retains the latest safe generated candidate as an explicitly non-final draft and reports each affected source paragraph, original quotation, corresponding rewrite text when found, issue type, difference summary, and corrective action. The interface shows these details with `Retry Rewrite`. It never substitutes an old review or rewrite result.

## Public source retrieval safety

Public URL retrieval is server-side and bounded to reduce SSRF and resource-exhaustion risk:

- only HTTP or HTTPS URLs without embedded credentials are accepted;
- localhost, local/internal hostnames, non-public IPv4 and IPv6 ranges, and any hostname resolving to a non-public address are rejected;
- redirects are handled manually, limited, and DNS/public-address validation is repeated for every destination;
- cookies and other credentials are omitted from fetches;
- only HTML and plain-text media types are accepted;
- time, redirect, declared-size, streamed-byte, and extracted-text limits are enforced.

Retrieved pages remain untrusted input. The extractor removes common navigation, advertising, script, style, and related-content containers before creating the bounded source snapshot, but users must still verify the extracted facts.

## Local testing

Run the complete automated quality gate:

    npm test

Or run checks separately:

    npm run typecheck
    npm run lint
    npm run test:unit
    npm run build

The unit and component suites cover:

- text, public-URL, URL-only, and automatic English/Chinese language inference;
- empty, whitespace-only, at-limit, and over-limit inputs;
- public-address URL validation, redirects, timeouts, content types, byte limits, and source extraction, including tests for private/reserved DNS answers;
- six-category score bounds, strict review JSON, weighted-score recomputation, deterministic caps, findings, risks, and readiness bands;
- passing and failing reviews making one Review Agent call each with no rewrite;
- review score and feedback rendering without final output;
- explicit Rewrite Agent requests after both high and low scores;
- separate, explicit, and repeated Rewrite Agent calls;
- source-change invalidation, immediate stale-output clearing, request sequencing, and duplicate-submit prevention;
- rewrite-error handling without restoration of an older result;
- threshold/decision normalization;
- missing API configuration;
- API authentication and rate-limit failures;
- request timeout and network-safe errors;
- malformed, empty, and truncated AI responses;
- request content type, request JSON, and request-size limits;
- news-editor prompt structure, factual fidelity, language/script preservation, press-release-artifact removal, and untrusted-data boundaries;
- quotation classification, Unicode normalization, repeated/nested forms, modification, omission, splitting, merging, punctuation changes, one focused retry, and actionable retained-candidate errors;
- deterministic review regression coverage proving legacy factual-risk flags cannot lower scores or trigger caps, plus strong and poor Traditional Chinese and English writing samples and internal-contradiction cases;
- a 12-case bilingual rewrite set spanning language/script preservation, mixed-language names, rough notes, promotional releases, quotations, dates, statistics, allegations, uncertainty, missing information, placeholders, contradictions, and prompt injection.

### Browser testing without a real API key

The bundled mock provider is for local QA only. Run it in one PowerShell window:

    cd "C:\AI\AI-Agent-News-Review-Rewrite"
    npm run mock:grok

Run the site in another window:

    cd "C:\AI\AI-Agent-News-Review-Rewrite"
    $env:XAI_API_KEY="local-test-key"
    $env:XAI_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4010"
    $env:XAI_TIMEOUT_MS="1000"
    npm run dev

Useful mock inputs:

- A normal rough draft returns a low score and no rewrite.
- A draft containing `SIMULATE_PASS_REVIEW` returns a passing review and no rewrite.
- Clicking `Rewrite with AI` makes the only rewrite call and reveals the final-output panel.
- A draft containing `SIMULATE_REWRITE_FAILURE` returns a safe rewrite error while preserving review state.
- SIMULATE_AUTH_FAILURE returns an authentication error.
- SIMULATE_MALFORMED_REVIEW returns invalid Review Agent JSON.
- SIMULATE_TIMEOUT waits long enough to trigger the configured timeout.

The mock provider logs only the Review/Rewrite Agent call count, never draft content. Use browser responsive tools to check a desktop width around 1440 pixels and a mobile width around 390 pixels. Verify review-only rendering, both post-review actions, stale-review behavior, error retry, final-output gating, copy, repeated rewrite, and Start New Draft.

### Optional live model evaluations

The deterministic test suite is the default quality gate. Live evaluations require a running application, use the configured provider, may incur charges, and are not run by `npm test`.

Run the repeatable Review Agent scoring set:

    npm run eval:review:live

Run the focused writing-only provider gate (six requests, DeepSeek by default):

    npm run eval:review:writing-only

Set `LIVE_REVIEW_MODEL=grok-4.5` to run the identical six cases with Grok. The gate covers false but well-written information, fictional and unverifiable claims, an outdated claim, strong writing without citations, accurate information written poorly, and an internal contradiction. It rejects legacy factual-risk flags and factual-verification feedback while confirming appropriate writing deductions.

`EVAL_RUNS` defaults to 2 runs per case. `EVAL_IDS` selects a comma-separated subset, `EVAL_MODEL` records the non-secret model identifier used for the run, `REVIEW_EVAL_BASE_URL` changes the application URL, and `REVIEW_EVAL_TIMEOUT_MS` changes the per-request timeout. The JSON-lines output records case IDs, parameters, sub-scores, weighted and final scores, caps, bands, latency, parsing or HTTP errors, run spread, and bilingual strong-versus-poor separation. It never prints drafts, retrieved source text, credentials, rationales, or finding evidence.

Run the Rewrite Agent fidelity set:

    npm run eval:live

Set `LIVE_EVAL_IDS` to a comma-separated subset and `LIVE_EVAL_BASE_URL` when the site is not on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. The harness counts every request and checks traceability, exact quotations, required terms, new numbers or placeholders, prohibited boilerplate, outlet attribution, markdown, and the headline/body format. It never prints credentials.

These commands provide a repeatable basis for before/after or model-version comparisons. Current runs record `grok-4.5`, `reasoning_effort: high`, upstream streaming, and a 64,000-token output budget. The rewrite harness exercises the production route and its bounded retry behavior. Provider outputs can still vary, so recorded results are not a permanent quality guarantee.

## Editorial research basis

The Rewrite Agent's news-editor prompt uses shared, high-level principles such as source fidelity, concise structure, close attribution, explicit uncertainty, and separation of reporting from promotion. The writing-only Review Agent does not use these sources for factual verification and never compares a draft with external reporting. Neither prompt copies article wording or imitates an outlet's voice. Research reviewed for rewrite/editorial design:

## Input and data limits

- Drafts are limited to 50,000 characters.
- Public source URLs are limited to 2,048 characters and must resolve only to public internet addresses.
- Review requests accept a draft, a public source URL, or both; picture upload and user-supplied image-text fields are rejected.
- Browser requests may select only `deepseek-v4-pro` or `grok-4.5`; both use high reasoning.
- Public page retrieval defaults to an 8-second timeout, three redirects, and 1.5 MB of response bytes before bounded text extraction.
- API request bodies are limited to 220,000 bytes.
- The active article, review, and successful rewrite turns are stored only in tab-scoped browser `sessionStorage`; there is no server database or account-level history. Source changes and `Start New Draft` clear the stored session.
- Submitted copy and retrieved text are sent to the selected provider and are subject to that provider's terms and data handling.

## Troubleshooting

### The server says the API key is not configured

Confirm the key for the selected model (`XAI_API_KEY` or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) is set in .env.local and restart the server. Do not place either key in a NEXT_PUBLIC variable.

### A provider rejects the credentials

Check that the matching provider key is active and copied without surrounding quotation marks. The site reports a provider-specific authentication error without exposing credentials.

### The request times out

Retry with a shorter draft or check the selected provider's service availability. High-reasoning requests stream upstream and may legitimately take several minutes; the server timeout defaults to ten minutes, and the interface shows live elapsed time while it waits.

### The model is rejected

The website accepts only `deepseek-v4-pro` and `grok-4.5`, with `grok-4.5` as the project default. Unsupported identifiers are rejected before routing. A provider-side rejection reports the workflow stage, provider, selected model, upstream HTTP status, and a sanitized cause without exposing credentials or provider reasoning.

### The Review Agent returns invalid JSON

Retry the request. JSON Output is enabled, but the backend still validates every field and fails safely if output is malformed, empty, or truncated.

### A source URL is rejected

Only public HTTP or HTTPS article pages without embedded credentials are supported. Localhost, private/internal destinations, unsafe redirects, unsupported media types, oversized pages, and pages that exceed the retrieval timeout are rejected rather than fetched permissively. Paste the article text directly if a public site blocks bounded server-side retrieval.

### Quotation preservation still fails after retry

The backend has already used its single focused correction attempt. Review the displayed paragraph, original quotation, candidate quotation, difference, and suggested action. The retained candidate is diagnostic and is not marked final; use `Retry Rewrite` to start a new explicit request after checking the source quotation.

### A hydration warning mentions data-sharkid

`data-sharkid` is injected into form controls by the Surfshark browser extension's Alternative ID autofill feature before React hydrates the page. It is not generated by this application or included in the server HTML. Disable Surfshark Alternative ID automatic form filling for localhost, disable the extension, or use a private/clean browser profile where the extension is not enabled. Do not add `suppressHydrationWarning`; it would only hide the external DOM mutation.

### Copy does not work

Clipboard access can be restricted outside localhost or HTTPS. Select the final-output textarea and copy manually if the browser denies permission.

### Port 3000 is already in use

    $env:PORT="3001"
    npm run dev

Then open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Remaining operational limitations

A live success request requires a user-supplied key for the selected provider and may incur provider charges. Some public sites may block or render content in a way that prevents bounded server-side extraction.

Hostname addresses are checked before each fetch and redirect, but native `fetch` performs its own subsequent DNS resolution; the validated address is not pinned to the connection. A hostile domain could therefore attempt DNS rebinding in that time-of-check/time-of-use window. Use a resolver-pinning egress proxy before treating public-URL retrieval as a hardened fetcher for fully adversarial URLs.

Although the supported providers may offer multimodal models, this application sends text only and does not offer picture upload, visual analysis, or user-supplied image OCR/caption inputs. Quotation classification, Chinese person-name extraction, and named-speaker proximity detection are deliberately conservative heuristics, and provider output remains probabilistic. Deterministic checks cover exact quotations, high-confidence named attribution beside them, extracted source-script names, figures, mixed-language terms, format, and output language, but a human editor must still verify full semantic fidelity, ambiguous or indirect attribution, units, and publication readiness.

## Accounts and Cloudflare deployment

The review/rewrite workspace now requires an approved client or employee
session. Account requests, employee approval/rejection, single-use password
setup, login, RBAC, CSRF-protected APIs, client removal, and server-side logout
use Cloudflare D1 and Worker-compatible cryptography. The Admin Panel is
available only to the `employee` role and separates account approvals, client
accounts, and employee accounts.

The Client Accounts tab aggregates AI-request usage on the backend for rolling
windows from 15 minutes through 365 days, Hong Kong month-to-date and
year-to-date windows, and Lifetime. Review and rewrite attempts are recorded at
the same pre-provider point as the original lifetime counters. Migration
`0016_timestamped_agent_request_events.sql` starts timestamped tracking and
adds user/time indexes; it does not fabricate timestamps for older requests.
Existing aggregate lifetime totals remain intact. Consequently, a time range
that begins before the migration is marked as partial in the Admin Panel,
while Lifetime still includes those earlier aggregate-only requests.

The same timestamped events drive optional automatic client protection.
Employees can configure and independently enable positive whole-number limits
for rolling 15-minute, 1-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour periods. Each rule
also has its own suspension time in hours, accepting values from `0.01` through
`8760` with up to two decimal places. All rules are disabled by default. A
syntactically valid request that takes a client above an enabled limit is
counted, recorded, and blocked before the AI provider is called; the account
then remains blocked for the triggering rule's configured suspension time.
Concurrent event insertion, lifetime-counter maintenance, breach selection, and
the immutable suspension audit entry execute as one serialized D1 statement.
The shortest breached period is recorded when rules overlap, an active
suspension is never extended by later attempts, and employee accounts are
exempt. Migration `0017_configurable_agent_usage_suspensions.sql` adds the
configuration, audit records, suspension state, and database triggers. It adds
no environment variables. Migration
`0020_configurable_agent_suspension_duration.sql` adds per-rule durations while
preserving six hours as the default for existing configurations.

Employees can also suspend an active client manually from the Client Accounts
list. The required administrator reason is normalized, shown again at final
confirmation, and emailed to the client. Manual suspension keeps the account
and all related data, revokes every current session, and blocks later logins
with `This account has been suspended. Please check your email for details.`
Automatic usage suspension now revokes account access in the same way for its
configured duration. A single **Recover account** confirmation clears either a
manual suspension, an active automatic suspension, or both without changing
the password or retained client data. Migration
`0021_client_account_suspension_and_recovery.sql` adds manual state, audited
suspension/recovery actions, and session-level enforcement.

Passwords must contain 9–63 English keyboard characters. No uppercase,
lowercase, number, symbol, or character-combination rule is imposed. Passwords
use scrypt (`N=32768`, `r=8`, `p=3`) in the browser or employee CLI. D1 stores
only a versioned, server-peppered HMAC of the derived proof, not a reusable
proof or plaintext password. This keeps strong password storage while avoiding
Cloudflare Free's 10 ms request CPU ceiling.

Client applications do not use email verification codes or verification links.
They are submitted directly for manual administrator approval. Approval and
password-setup emails remain part of the account lifecycle.

Create an employee interactively with one command. It prompts for email, full
name, password, and password confirmation, checks for an existing account,
hashes the password, and writes directly to the selected D1 environment:

```powershell
# Local D1 (default)
npm run create-employee

# Equivalent explicit local command
npm run create-employee:local

# Cloudflare D1; the target is fixed by this script
npm run create-employee:remote
```

Apply the matching migrations before running the command. The local and remote
scripts pass an explicit target directly to the employee-creation program, so
npm cannot silently consume a forwarded `--remote` option. Set
`AUTH_D1_DATABASE_NAME` to use a non-default database name.

commands, email-provider envelope, deployment steps, security controls, test
coverage, and current limitations.
